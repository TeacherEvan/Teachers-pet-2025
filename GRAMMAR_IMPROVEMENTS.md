### Grammar Problems:
1. **❌ "his classroom behavior"** - Should be **"His classroom behavior"** (sentence beginning)
2. **❌ "his collaborative spirit"** - Should be **"His collaborative spirit"** (sentence beginning)

## Grammar Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Pronoun System
**File:** `optimized-comment-generator.js`

**Added capitalized pronoun variants:**
```javascript
pronouns: {
  he: {
    subject: "He",
    subject_lower: "he",
    object: "him",
    possessive: "his",
    possessive_cap: "His",  // ← NEW: Capitalized possessive
    verb: "has",
    isAre: "is",
    reflexive: "himself",
  },
  // Similar for she/they
}
```

### 2. Updated Templates
**Fixed sentence-starting pronouns in templates:**

**Before:**
```javascript
"{pronoun_possessive} classroom behavior reflects {attitude}..."
"{pronoun_possessive} collaborative spirit and friendly nature..."
```

**After:**
```javascript
"{pronoun_possessive_cap} classroom behavior reflects {attitude}..."
"{pronoun_possessive_cap} collaborative spirit and friendly nature..."
```

### 3. Enhanced replacePlaceholders Function
**Added grammar improvement post-processing:**

```javascript
improveGrammar(text) {
  // Fix capitalization after sentence endings
  text = text.replace(/([.!?]\s+)([a-z])/g, (match, punctuation, letter) => {
    return punctuation + letter.toUpperCase();
  });
  
  // Ensure proper capitalization at text beginning
  text = text.replace(/^([a-z])/, (match, letter) => {
    return letter.toUpperCase();
  });
  
  // Fix specific pronoun issues
  text = text.replace(/\.\s+his\s+/g, '. His ');
  text = text.replace(/\.\s+her\s+/g, '. Her ');
  text = text.replace(/\.\s+their\s+/g, '. Their ');
  
  return text;
}
```

### 4. Replacement Data Enhancement
**Added capitalized pronoun support:**
```javascript
const replacementData = {
  // ... existing data
  pronoun_possessive: pronouns.possessive,           // "his"
  pronoun_possessive_cap: pronouns.possessive_cap,   // "His" 
  // ... 
};
```
